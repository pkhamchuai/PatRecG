<h3 align="left">Description</h3>
<p align="left">Note that the original dataset has been modified to fit into the
standard sequence recognition format, where strings are coded as sequences of
integers in the range (0, .. (1 - alphabet size)).</p>
<p align="left">Here is a description of the original dataset (provided by Jens
Gregor)</p>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">The database consists of 44 files, e.g., dif22da,</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">that each have 100 lines of the form</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">/ 5467 119 22 27 9 / AA==a==E===d==A==a=Aa=A=a=b</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">where 5467 is a unique chromosome identifier, 119 refers to the</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">metaphase the sample came from (1..180), 22 is the chromosome type,</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">27 is the overall string length, and 9 is the length of the p-arm,</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">i.e., the centromere position. The slashes are, of course, only</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">delimiters and should be ignored, i.e., the alphabet consists of</font></pre>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">the letters a-f, A-F.</font></pre>
<p>The dataset used in our sequence recognition experiments was obtained as
follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, the centromere positions were discarded, by ignoring the start of
each string up to the second slash.</p>
<p>Then, the following mapping was used to map letters into integers:</p>
<pre><b>    a     -&gt;    0
    b     -&gt;    1
    c     -&gt;    2
    d     -&gt;    3
    e     -&gt;    4
    f     -&gt;    5
    =     -&gt;    6
    A     -&gt;    7
    B     -&gt;    8
    C     -&gt;    9
    D     -&gt;    10
    E     -&gt;    11
    F     -&gt;    12
</b></pre>
<p>Note that in the original dataset the letters (and '=') represented a
difference coding of successive sample positions, where '=' meant that the two
successive samples were equal, and the upper and lower case letters were used to
represent positive and negative differences respectively.&nbsp; The alphabetic
position coded the level of the difference (a = diff of 1, e = diff of 5).</p>
<p>Therefore, one can build a recognizer for this dataset based on a weighted
Levenstein string distance measure that sets up weights based on these
difference levels.&nbsp; The paper below describes results based on an
efficiently computable approximation of such measures.&nbsp; </p>

  <h3><font color="#0000FF">On the Use of Normalized Edit Distances and an
  Efficient k-NN Search Technique (k-AESA) for Fast and Accurate String
  Classification</font></h3>

  <p><font color="#0000FF">Classification based on Nearest Neighbors (NN) is a
  uniformly good approach to many Pattern Recognition (PR) tasks. However, two
  important aspects need to be taken into account to actually achieve good
  performance in practice. The first one is the metric or dissimilarity measure
  adopted to compare the considered patterns. The second is the computational
  cost incurred by the NN searching operation. As it is shown in this paper, by
  using the adequate techniques to cope with these two issues, NN-based
  classification leads to better results than those obtained by other approaches
  that have been applied to a task of human banded chromosomes classification.</font></p>

<p>However, it is also of interest to see how well machine learning/pattern
recognition algorithms can do without this prior knowledge.&nbsp; This, and the
need to provide a standard interface that is appropriate across a wide class of
symbol sequence recognition problems, was the justification for recoding the
dataset as a set of integer sequences.</p>
<h3>Dataset Partitions</h3>
<p>There are two named versions of the dataset set up on the evaluation server:
CopChrom and CopChromRand, the difference being the way the dataset is
partitioned into training and test sets.</p>
<h4>CopChrom</h4>
<p>In CopChrom the partition is fixed, with the same test and training sets used
in the Juan and Vidal paper above (except that in their paper they also swapped
the test set with the training set in order to generate two experiments from the
fixed partition).</p>
<h4><a name="CopChromRand">CopChromRand</a></h4>
<p>In CopChromRand each experiment is run with a different random partition of
the dataset.&nbsp; In each case, a randomly chosen 50% of the data for each
class is used for training, with the remaining data being used for
testing.&nbsp; This allows for better estimates of the statistical significance
of the difference between various methods.&nbsp; A better alternative to using
different random partitions every time, would be to use an identified set of
random partitions - which would then allow us to use a more powerful paired
t-test, but this is not yet implemented so we use an unpaired t-test.&nbsp;
Since the different random partitions are drawn from the same sample, they are
not statistically independent, which means that the significance of the
differences are overstated.</p>
<h4><a name="CopChromTwo">CopChromTwo</a></h4>
<p>This dataset is like the randomized version above, except that only two
chromosome classes are included.&nbsp; We include chromosome classes 4 and 5, as
these are the ones with the highest mutual confusability when classified using
an unweighted edit distance measure.&nbsp; This allows for much faster testing
of new algorithms than using the full dataset - though we've yet to test the
correlation between performance on this data and performance on the full
dataset.</p>
